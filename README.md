# InBody-770 Data Analysis

The script I have made is designed to work on data extracted from the InBody-770 Bio-Impedance Body Composition machine in the form of a .xlsx file.

There are two files in the repo:

1. InBody-770 Data Analyser.py
2. InBody-770 Data Analyser Overview.docx

The .py file is the script itself, and the .docx file is an overview of the program, its development and background, and how it works, including a list of all the different functions it performs.

I made this script while interning at QuantumTX Pte. Ltd.
